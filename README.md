# Python Optimization Using Cython and the Python\C API

This repository has two main folders. 
1. `CPython` - Contains a small example of how to write a C++ extension for Python using the Python\C API.
2. `Cython` - This folder contains an example of using Cython with some code to visually examine
the speed difference between Python and Cython by using a bubble sort algorithm. 
The Cython code is _a lot_ faster than Python.
